v1.8
-----

    Bug fix - post correct links to Jenkins in Stash comments with recent Jenkins versions
    Added ability to probe Stash for the merge status to make Stash update the refspecs
    Using repackaged EasySSLProtocolSocketFactory from commons-httpclient
    Improved field names in the configuration
    Improved README.md

v1.7.1
-----

    Check the PR conflict state even if the PR is mergeable
    Change the default to check the conflict state
    Added documentation about merging and race conditions

v1.7.0
-----

    Bug fix - the only build on comment mode does not work after the first comment
    Added ability to merge on build success
    Added ability to cancel previously queued and running jobs when the PR is updated
    Using EnvironmentContributor for variables
    Only offer valid credentials in the credentials drop down

v1.6.0
-----

    Bug fix - Jenkins issue #30558 - sockets causing problems with hanging triggers
    Bug fix - include default parameter values in build queue
    Added project name to log messages

v1.5.3
-----

    Branch name filters can now be regular expressions
    Support all build states (now all states are reported, not just success or everything else as failure in the build PR comment)

v1.5.2
-----

    Fix PR branch filters

v1.5.1
-----

    Added ability to only keep the most recent PR status comment
    Logging improvements
    Ability to limit PR builds to specified target branches only

v1.5.0
-----

    Added credentials support - this is a breaking change, please add a username/password credential for the user you want PR build comments to be posted from. Old builds will fail until you update them with the right credentials from the credentials plugin. 
    Fixup branch & ref specs in git config - again this is a breaking change and you should update your git configuration (URL, ref spec & branch specifier), please see the updated README  

v1.4.2
-----

    Fix bug with Stash response code handling 

v1.4.1
-----

    Better error handling when Stash returns 200/OK response

    Option to ignore SSL certificates (useful if you dont have proper certificates with your Stash instance)
    Fixes for PR pagination

v1.4.0
-----

    Added build duration to build finished message in PR - useful for tracking runtimes/test overheads added in PRs.

    Bugfixes

v1.3.1
-----

    Use Git SCM as provider for hostname and credentials needed for the pull request builder
    Now it is also possible to verify pull requests from another fork (while previously it would only work in the same repository, or at least with the merge before build feature). Prerequisite is that you add +refs/pull-requests/:refs/remotes/origin/pr/ as refspec.
    Additionally you can filter on the target branch which makes you able to restrict checking pull requests on a specific (release) branch.
    Support for global environment variables has been added.

v1.2.0
-----

    Added post build custom comment support
    Marked credentials plugin as required dependency for upcoming v1.3.0 release with Credentials support

    Reduce logging verbosity

v1.0.0
-----
